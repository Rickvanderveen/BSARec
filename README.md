## 🛠️ Task Definition
_Define the recommendation task you are solving (e.g., sequential, generative, content-based, collaborative, ranking, etc.). Clearly describe inputs and outputs._

---

## 📂 Datasets

_Provide the following for all datasets, including the attributes you are considering to measure things like item fairness (for example)_:

- [ ] [Dataset Name](Link-to-dataset-DOI-or-URL)
  - [ ] Pre-processing: e.g., Removed items with fewer than 5 interactions, and users with fewer than 5 interactions
  - [ ] Subsets considered: e.g., Cold Start (5-10 items)
  - [ ] Dataset size: # users, # items, sparsity:
  - [ ] Attributes for user fairness (only include if used):
  - [ ] Attributes for item fairness (only include if used):
  - [ ] Attributes for group fairness (only include if used):
  - [ ] Other attributes (only include if used):
